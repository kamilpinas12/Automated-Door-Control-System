The Automated Door Control System is a project developed using an STM32 (Blue Pill) microcontroller, designed to automatically open and close a chicken coop door based on ambient light conditions.

- DC motor controlled with PWM
- light sensor
- limit switches
- overcurrent protection
- manual control
- error led,t he LED will blink a specific number of times depending on the type of error occurred, for example to high current, incorrect voltage or too long closing/opening time
